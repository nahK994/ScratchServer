## TCPickle - A Lightweight TCP Server

Welcome to the **TCPickle** repository! This project is a work in progress and aims to implement a basic TCP server from scratch using Go.

### 🚧 Project Status

This project is still in development. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome!

### 🛠️ Features

- Accepts multiple client connections.
- Handles basic HTTP methods such as GET and POST.
- Simple error handling and logging.

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- **Go** (version 1.20 or later)

#### How to Use

You can easily add this package to your Go project by running the following command:

```go
go get github.com/nahK994/TCPickle
```

After installing the package, you can start the server locally in your main.go file with the following code:

```go
srv := server.Initiate("127.0.0.1:8000")
srv.RequestHandler("/login", "POST", func(r models.Request, w *models.Response) {
    fmt.Println("TEST ===>", r.Body)
    w.StatusCode = 201
    w.Body = r.Body
})
log.Fatal(srv.Start())
```

You can also check out the complete example in `main.go`.
